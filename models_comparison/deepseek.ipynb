      "   - \"Не можу слухати меланхолійної музики. А вже найменше такої, що приваблює зразу душу ясними, до танцю визиваючими граціозними звуками, а відтак, зрікаючися їх незамітно, ллється лиш одною широкою струєю смутку!\"\n",
      "   - \"Обнімала би тоді цілий світ, заявляючи далеко-широко, що музика грає!\"\n",
      "   - \"Бути уже майже укінченою артисткою і працювала саме над одним образом, який хотіла продати і поїхати до Італії, щоб побачити тамошню штуку.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Relevant Topics:**\n",
      "   - 1. questions about the personalities of the characters\n",
      "   - 3. what the characters did in certain situations\n",
      "   - 4. what the characters did in certain situations, what they thought or felt\n",
      "   - 5. the attitude of some characters to other characters\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential Questions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   a. **Question:** Як музика впливає на слухачку в тексті?\n",
      "   \n",
      "      - **Correct Answer:** Вона розпадається в чуття і не може опертися настроєві суму.\n",
      "      - **Incorrect Answers:** \n",
      "        1. Вона стає дуже спокійною і роздумливою.\n",
      "        2. Вона завжди починає співати разом з музикою.\n",
      "        3. Вона майже не помічає, як змінюється музика.\n",
      "\n",
      "      **Evaluation:** \n",
      "      - Clarity: High, the question is straightforward and specific.\n",
      "      - Relevance: Very relevant, as it directly assesses understanding of the character's emotional response to music.\n",
      "      - Difficulty: Moderate, understanding requires connecting emotional response to described music.\n",
      "      - Age-appropriateness: Suitable for children familiar with emotional and mood descriptions.\n",
      "      - Topic Alignment: Directly aligns with topic 4, understanding thoughts and feelings.\n",

      "\n",
      "      **Evaluation:**\n",
      "      - Clarity: High, the question is focused on a clear goal of the character.\n",
      "      - Relevance: Closely related to the aspirations and actions of the character.\n",
      "      - Difficulty: Moderate, as it requires attention to details and understanding of motivations.\n",
      "      - Age-appropriateness: Suitable for children familiar with personal goals and efforts.\n",
      "      - Topic Alignment: Matches topic 3, about actions and intentions in specific situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Chosen Question:** I chose question (b) as it directly assesses understanding of the character's motivations and situational actions, which are explicitly described in the text. This question not only checks for comprehension of details but also encourages reflection on the character’s aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Selected Text Part:** \"Бути уже майже укінченою артисткою і працювала саме над одним образом, який хотіла продати і поїхати до Італії, щоб побачити тамошню штуку.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Explanation:** The chosen question is the best option because it offers a clear, focused inquiry into a character's specific intention and action, providing a comprehension checkpoint that's both manageable and educational for children. It requires them to recall specific details while understanding broader context, suitable for developing reading comprehension skills.\n",
